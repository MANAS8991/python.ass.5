    "Dictionary: A dictionary stores values as key-value pairs. Each value in a dictionary is associated with a unique key, allowing for efficient retrieval of values based on their corresponding keys. Keys in a dictionary must be immutable objects (such as strings, numbers, or tuples), and they provide a way to uniquely identify and access the associated values.\n",
    "List: A list stores values as an ordered sequence. The elements in a list are indexed based on their position, starting from 0. Each element can be accessed by its index, allowing for positional retrieval of values. Lists are mutable, meaning elements can be modified, added, or removed.\n",
